## Structure

- [ ] Is the most important information at the top?
- [ ] Can you understand the overview from headings alone?
- [ ] Is there a table of contents (for long documents)?
- [ ] Is the hierarchy within 2 levels?

## Content

- [ ] Is it technically accurate?
- [ ] Is all necessary information covered?
- [ ] Do code examples and configuration samples work?
- [ ] Are sources and reference links provided?
- [ ] Are version information and last-updated dates included?

## Writing

- [ ] Does it use plain language?
- [ ] Are sentences short (one idea per sentence)?
- [ ] Is the writing style consistent?
- [ ] Does it use bullet lists, tables, and code blocks effectively?
- [ ] Are temporal expressions made specific ("recently", "currently" → dates/versions)?

## Practicality

- [ ] Is the "why" explained?
- [ ] Are there concrete examples?
- [ ] Can steps be executed as-is?
- [ ] Can someone who joined today understand it?

## Maintainability

- [ ] Is content not duplicated with other documents?
- [ ] Are external links not excessive?
- [ ] For how-to guides: are feature explanations delegated to official docs (link, don't duplicate)?
- [ ] Are there no expressions that become stale over time ("the latest ..." / "new version" → version numbers/dates)?
